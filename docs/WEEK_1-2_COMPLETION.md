## 🚀 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Install PostgreSQL
```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql@16

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install postgresql-16

# Windows
# Download from postgresql.org
```

### Step 2: Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE school_dashboard;
```

### Step 3: Run Migration
```bash
cd database/migrations
psql -U postgres -d school_dashboard -f 001_create_schema.sql
```

### Step 4: Generate Mock Data
```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_mock_data.py \
  --students 100 \
  --teachers 20 \
  --dbname school_dashboard
```

### Step 5: Verify Setup
```sql
-- Check tables
\dt

-- Check record counts
SELECT 'students' as table, COUNT(*) as count FROM students
UNION ALL
SELECT 'teachers', COUNT(*) FROM teachers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'grades', COUNT(*) FROM grades;
```

## ✅ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before moving to Week 3-4 (Backend Development), ensure:

### Database Setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL 16+ is installed and running
- [ ] Database `school_dashboard` exists
- [ ] All 7 tables are created successfully
- [ ] All foreign key relationships are working
- [ ] All check constraints are enforced
- [ ] All indexes are created
- [ ] All 3 views are accessible

### Mock Data
- [ ] Mock data script runs without errors
- [ ] At least 20 teachers exist
- [ ] At least 100 students exist
- [ ] Students are distributed across classes
- [ ] Courses are assigned to classes
- [ ] Grades exist for students
- [ ] Attendance records span 90+ days
- [ ] Default login credentials work:
  - Admin: admin@school.edu.vn / Admin@123
  - Teacher: teacher1@school.edu.vn / Teacher@123
  - Student: student1@school.edu.vn / Student@123

### Sample Queries Work
- [ ] Get all students in a class
- [ ] Calculate average grade per student
- [ ] Calculate attendance rate
- [ ] Get course enrollment statistics
- [ ] Filter students by grade level
- [ ] Get teacher's assigned classes

### Documentation
- [ ] ERD is clear and understandable
- [ ] Database design document is complete
- [ ] Setup guide is accurate
- [ ] All SQL scripts are tested

---

## 📈 SAMPLE QUERIES TO TEST

### Query 1: Student List with Classes
```sql
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.name as class_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN classes c ON s.class_id = c.id
LIMIT 10;
```

### Query 2: Average Grades
```sql
SELECT 
  s.first_name || ' ' || s.last_name as student_name,
  ROUND(AVG(g.grade), 2) as avg_grade
FROM students s
JOIN grades g ON s.id = g.student_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.first_name, s.last_name
ORDER BY avg_grade DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Query 3: Attendance Rate
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_attendance_rate
WHERE attendance_rate < 80
ORDER BY attendance_rate ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Query 4: Course Enrollment
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_course_enrollment
ORDER BY enrolled_students DESC;
```

## 📝 KEY LEARNINGS FROM WEEK 1-2

### What Went Well ✅
- Database schema is well-normalized (3NF)
- Foreign key relationships prevent orphaned records
- Check constraints ensure data integrity
- Indexes optimize common queries
- Views simplify complex queries
- Mock data is realistic and varied

### Technical Decisions Made 📋
- **PostgreSQL** chosen for:
  - ACID compliance
  - Strong typing with ENUMs
  - Excellent performance
  - JSON support for future AI data
- **UUID** for primary keys:
  - Better for distributed systems
  - No collision risk
  - Harder to guess (security)
- **Timestamps** on all tables:
  - Audit trail capability
  - Updated automatically via triggers
- **Soft delete** ready:
  - Can add `deleted_at` column later
  - Preserves historical data

### Areas for Future Improvement 🔄
- Consider adding audit log table
- May need to add `deleted_at` for soft deletes
- Could add `last_login` to users table
- Consider partitioning for attendance table (if > 1M records)
- Add full-text search indexes for searching by name

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS: WEEK 3-4

### Backend Development Tasks
1. **Setup Express.js Project**
   - Initialize npm project ✅ (package.json created)
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure environment variables
   - Setup folder structure

2. **Database Connection**
   - Setup Sequelize ORM
   - Create models matching database schema
   - Test database connectivity

3. **Authentication System**
   - JWT token generation
   - Login/Register endpoints
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Token verification middleware

4. **Core API Endpoints**
   - Students CRUD
   - Teachers CRUD
   - Classes CRUD
   - Grades CRUD
   - Attendance CRUD
   - Dashboard aggregation endpoint

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for models
   - Integration tests for APIs
   - Test with Postman

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Issue**: psql command not found  
**Solution**: Add PostgreSQL to PATH or use full path

**Issue**: Permission denied for schema public  
**Solution**: Run `GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO your_user;`

**Issue**: Mock data script fails  
**Solution**: Check database connection and install requirements

**Issue**: Foreign key constraint violation  
**Solution**: Ensure parent records exist before inserting child records
